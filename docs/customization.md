# Customization

### Include Your Business Data

In the `/data` folder, you'll find the following files:

- **agency-description.md**: Contains information about your agency or business, including name, description, and contact details. Replace this with your own agency or business details.
- **case_studies**: Includes past case studies that will be referenced in reports, emails, and interviews. Update this file with your own case studies to personalize the generated content.

Ensure that these files are updated to reflect your own company's information and the specific details you want to highlight in your outreach and reports.

## Customizing CRM Integrations

### Overview
To integrate your custom CRM with the `LeadLoaderBase` class, you need to inherit from `LeadLoaderBase` and implement two methods:
- `fetch_records`: Fetches the leads matching the given status.
- `update_record`: Updates the lead record with new fields.

By default, the available statuses used in the `LeadLoaderBase` class are:
```python
available_statuses = [
    "NEW",
    "UNQUALIFIED",
    "ATTEMPTED_TO_CONTACT"
]
```
However, these statuses can be customized to match the specific lead status values in your CRM.

### Steps to Add a Custom CRM Integration

1. **Create a New Class for Your CRM**
   Inherit from `LeadLoaderBase` and implement the two abstract methods: `fetch_records` and `update_record`.

   ```python
   class CustomCRMLeadLoader(LeadLoaderBase):
       def __init__(self, api_key, custom_parameter):
           # Initialize any API clients or configurations here
           self.api_key = api_key
           self.custom_parameter = custom_parameter

       def fetch_records(self, status_filter="NEW"):
           # Implement API call to fetch leads from your CRM
           leads = your_crm_api.get_leads(status=status_filter)
           return [
               {
                   "id": lead.id,
                   "name": lead.name,
                   "email": lead.email,
                   "phone": lead.phone
               }
               for lead in leads
           ]

       def update_record(self, lead_id, updates: dict):
           # Implement API call to update a lead in your CRM
           updated_lead = your_crm_api.update_lead(lead_id, updates)
           return updated_lead
   ```

2. **Implement the `fetch_records` Method**
   This method should interact with your CRM API and return a list of leads matching the `status_filter`. The return value should be a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a lead, typically including fields such as `id`, `name`, `email`, and `phone`.

   Example:
   ```python
   def fetch_records(self, status_filter="NEW"):
       records = some_crm_api.get_leads(status=status_filter)
       return [
           {
               "id": record.id,
               "name": record.name,
               "email": record.email,
               "phone": record.phone
           }
           for record in records
       ]
   ```

3. **Implement the `update_record` Method**
   This method should accept a `lead_id` and an `updates` dictionary, where the keys in the dictionary correspond to the fields you want to update. The method should return the updated lead after the API call.

   Example:
   ```python
   def update_record(self, lead_id, updates: dict):
       updated_lead = some_crm_api.update_lead(lead_id, updates)
       return updated_lead
   ```

4. **Customizing Lead Statuses**
   By default, the class uses the following statuses:
   ```python
   available_statuses = [
       "NEW",
       "UNQUALIFIED",
       "ATTEMPTED_TO_CONTACT"
   ]
   ```
   If your CRM uses different statuses or additional ones, you can customize this list to match your system. For example, if your CRM uses statuses such as `"IN_PROGRESS"` or `"CONTACTED"`, you can update the `available_statuses` like this:

   ```python
   available_statuses = [
       "NEW",
       "IN_PROGRESS",
       "CONTACTED"
   ]
   ```

   Make sure to update the `fetch_records` method to reflect these changes. For example, if you want to fetch leads with a status of `"IN_PROGRESS"`, you can call `fetch_records(status_filter="IN_PROGRESS")`.

## Customizing the `update_CRM` Function for Different Field Names

### Overview
By default, the `update_CRM` function uses a fixed set of fields (e.g., "Status", "Score", "Analysis Reports", "Outreach Report", "Last Contacted") when updating a CRM record. However, different CRMs or database schemas may use different field names or additional fields that need to be handled.

### Steps to Customize the `update_CRM` Function

1. **Identify the Fields in Your CRM**
   Each CRM or database may have different field names or additional fields. Start by identifying which fields you need to map from your system to the CRM. This may include:
   - Custom field names (e.g., `lead_score` instead of `Score`)
   - Additional fields (e.g., `custom_field_1`, `custom_field_2`)

2. **Modify the `new_data` Dictionary**
   The `new_data` dictionary in the `update_CRM` function is where the lead data is prepared before updating the CRM. You can modify this dictionary to include your custom fields.

   For example, if your CRM has a custom field `custom_lead_score` instead of `Score`, you can modify the dictionary like this:

   ```python
   new_data = {
       "Status": "ATTEMPTED_TO_CONTACT",  # Set lead to attempted contact
       "Custom Lead Score": state["lead_score"],  # Updated field name
       "Analysis Reports": state["reports_folder_link"],
       "Outreach Report": state["custom_outreach_report_link"],
       "Last Contacted": get_current_date(),
       "Custom Field 1": state["custom_field_1"],  # Example of an additional field
   }
   ```

### Notes:
- **Field Names**: Always check the database to ensure that the field names you're using match the database schema (names are case-sensitive).

## Customizing Prompts

### Overview
In the `prompts.py` file, you will find predefined prompts used for various tasks in your outreach automation. These prompts can be customized to better fit your specific needs, whether for qualifying leads, generating reports, personalizing outreach emails, or preparing interview questions. This guide explains how to update and modify these prompts.

### 1. **Qualifying Leads**
   The prompt used for qualifying leads can be updated to reflect different criteria, depending on the business requirements. You can modify this prompt to suit your specific qualification process and the fields available in your CRM.

### 2. **Generating Reports**
   The report generation prompt can be customized to match different report formats, structures, or analysis points. You can add or remove sections, change the data fields, or adjust the language to fit your needs.

### 3. **Personalized Lead Outreach Email Template**
   The lead outreach email template can be modified to reflect your personalized messaging. This includes updating the language, structure, or including any unique data that you want to add to the email. You can tailor the subject lines, email body, or call-to-action based on your audience and goals.

### 4. **Generating Interview Preparation Questions**
   The interview preparation script and questions can be customized by modifying the following prompts:
   - `GENERATE_SPIN_QUESTIONS_PROMPT`: Tailor the questions to focus on specific aspects of the leadâ€™s needs, role, or challenges.
   - `WRITE_INTERVIEW_SCRIPT_PROMPT`: Adjust the script to focus on the key areas you want to assess during the interview.
